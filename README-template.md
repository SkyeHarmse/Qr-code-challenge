### What I learned

i didnt learn anything really, maybe i did but this is the first challenge i have done with ease since freeCodeCamp course.
i tried doing one of these challenges before and struggled for hours.
this took me about 30 minutes from start to finnish, and i am honestly very happy with the bit of progress i've made from the beginning of the month.


### Continued development

in the future id like to take this project to the next level and add some functionality or some sexy css animations/styles to make the whole page pop!
